# Geolocation of IP addresses

BrowserAudit makes use of geolocation data published by [MaxMind](https://www.maxmind.com/en/home). Either of the [GeoIP2](https://www.maxmind.com/en/geoip2-databases) (commercial) or [GeoLite2](http://dev.maxmind.com/geoip/geoip2/geolite2/) (free) geolocation databases is required to run the server.

Place the file here, and adjust `../development-server.yml` accordingly.
